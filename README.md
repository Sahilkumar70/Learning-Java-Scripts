# JavaScript Learning Repo

This repository contains my personal JavaScript learning practice.  
I use it to experiment with core concepts, DOM manipulation, and small logic exercises.

## Goals

- Build a strong foundation in core JavaScript
- Practice DOM and browser-related features
- Improve problem-solving and code readability
- Get comfortable with Git and GitHub workflow

## Contents

- Basic syntax experiments
- Small practice snippets
- DOM and event handling practice
- Miscellaneous JS exercises

_Files and structure may change frequently as I keep practicing._

## How to Run

1. Clone or download the repository:
2. Open the project folder in your code editor.
3. Open the corresponding `index.html` file in a browser to test the scripts.

## Notes

This repository is for learning purposes only.  
Code quality may vary as I try out different ideas and approaches.
